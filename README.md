# IMDB-WebscraperPy

This is my very first python project and github upload so please understand the ugliness lol.

This is a IMDB WebScrapper using Python, Beautifulsoup4, Requests and Openpyxl. It scrapes the top 250 movies OAT and then makes and fills an excel file with that info.
I built it with the option of sorting by release date and IMDB score.

One Sentence Definition of Web Scraping:
"Web scraping is having your computer visit many web pages, collect (scrape) data from each page, and save it locally to your computer for future use. Itâ€™s something you could do with copy/paste and an Excel table, but the sheer number of pages makes it impractical."
